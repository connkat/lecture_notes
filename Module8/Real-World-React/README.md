# Module8W21 - Real World React
This is the end of React for now! Although there is definitely a learning curve, you can now see how powerful of a tool React is when developing projects. 

## TODO
- [x] The good, the bad, the ugly
- [x] React Router
- [x] Styled Components
- [x] MUI
- [x] useContext
- [x] Deployment of React apps (to Heroku and Netlify)--links to tutorials

### What we aren't covering today, but are useful to checkout: 
- useRef
- Reducers

## The good, the bad, the ugly
- state is confusing
- didn't love it
- custom hooks are confusing/when to use
- props/prop drilling confusing
- spread operator 

```
[ value, setValue ] = useState(0)

//WRONG: 
const newValue = value + 1

//RIGHT: 
const newValue = {...value} +1

```

- look into history to better understand useVisualMode

## React Router
*the differences between v5 and v6 are significant, so if you look at the docs make sure you are looking at the right version!*

## Styled Components

Alts: useStyles

## MUI

## useContext

## Deployment of React apps (to Heroku and Netlify)
